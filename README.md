# Mental-Health-in-Collage-Students

# ABSTRACT
Acknowledging how serious and underrated a problem mental health is at higher academic
institutions, where it is commonplace to hear about people harming themselves and others
around them due to improper treatment and action towards the psychological issues and
mental pressure they were subject to, through this study we have proposed and designed a
model that attempts to battle prejudice against mental health as well as making
psychological well-being practices a part of our daily routine. After initial research and
survey phases in this project, we designed a counselling scheme with rules and guidelines
for counsellors and students alike to make counselling a day to day activity. Furthermore we
designed and published a website that is a proof of concept working model for a free online
counselling service for VIT students.
# INTRODUCTION
There are many programs throughout our country encouraging citizens to prioritize on their
physical fitness, many of which are endorsed by the Prime Minister himself. Although the
Prime Minister urged in one of his speeches to openly discuss depression, mental health and
wellbeing remains an issue that not even properly understood in our society and therefore
doesn’t have the same publicity as physical health. While physical health is no doubt a very
significant aspect of our lives and will benefit us greatly in the long run, mental health is
equally if not more important as it impacts how we live life right now at this very moment.
In a study conducted by the Asian Journal of Psychiatry it was found that when a sample of
500 randomly selected students were questioned it was found that a terrifying 53% were
suffering from moderate to severe depression. Although this is a shocking figure, in a system
like ours where there are thousands of pressures involving academics, peers, family
relations and self-image it is not surprising that many students, who are still finding their
path in life suffer from mental health disorders. It is also similarly concerning that 26% of
the population feel afraid of people suffering from mental issues, referring to them with
insensitive labels like “retard” or “crazy”. As a result people with mental health problems
tend to stay quiet about their problems and let their condition fester till it is too late. This
even more so a problem amongst people of our age as we have a mind-set that adults don’t
understand our problems and will most likely tell us to get over it. For these reasons our
project has the two following main objectives.
The first objective is to counter the prejudice towards mental illness as mentioned above.
We aim to devise a system that will spread awareness about the reality of mental health,
what it is and how it affects us. This will not only help the general public gain some insight
on the perspective of people who are suffering, but also help them see mental health as
something that needs to be actively cared for and not a problem that the patient can “just
let go” or “move on” . It will also help those people who are suffering realize that they are
not alone in their struggle and that their condition isn’t something to hide or be ashamed of.
The implementation of this will be through a series of lectures taken by both trained
professionals as well as people who have actually suffered from a mental illness.
The second objective will be to make counselling part of the norm at our college. Many
students still feel that going to counselling is something that should be done in secret as it
would reflect negatively on their image in front of their peers. To eliminate this feeling we
need to bring counselling into the mainstream routine of students similar to how lectures or
extra-curricular are. For this we would be creating a system of rules that requires each
student to spend a certain amount of mandatory time conversing with a trained counsellor
even if it is something mundane like what all they did throughout the week and how they
felt about something that has been going on in their life. For those suffering from mental
illness this would be a much needed therapy, and even for those who aren’t suffering
expressing their feelings instead of bottling them up will be greatly helpful in reducing stress
levels and providing with the necessary confidence. This system will also revise the current
counselling scenario at the college to make it more efficient and emergency friendly.

# KEY OBJECTIVES
The key objectives of this project that have been mentioned in the above section as well
are:
1. Understand how mental health is perceived by college students. This will be done by
conducting a survey with questions about mental health and attitude towards it. A
further set of interviews will also be conducted to deeply understand the perspective
of students on the topic.
2. Devise a system of rules and guidelines that will henceforth called as the VIT
Counselling Scheme. This will bring counselling into the mainstream by making
certain hours of one on one counselling mandatory in each month. This will make
sure there is no stigma or singling out of those who need counselling and are
suffering from mental health issues
3. Create a medium through which awareness about mental health can be created. This
will also be done through a provision of the VIT Counselling scheme that we will be
formatting.
4. Create a website that provides an E-Counselling service through which students can
reach out to counsellors at their own convenience without having to meet them
physically thus removing any hesitation they might feel for undertaking counselling.
The website will also be a medium through which students can share their
experiences battling mental health through regulated blog posts
# RESEARCH
To understand the intricacies of the issue we were dealing with we formulated a survey to
get opinions from our peers on their opinions on mental health as a subject. The method we
used to obtain the results in a quantifiable manner was through google forms.
The results of the survey based on the responses and what we were able to learn from them
are summarized below in the form of points and charts:-

# Selected responses to QUalitative QUestions
1. Your friend has been diagnosed with low-grade persistent depression. What would your
reaction be if he told you that he was soon to undergo therapy?

2. I would support him

3. Shocked

4. It’s good for him I would also suggest that

5. Happy that he is getting help and be supportive

6. Encourage him to take the treatment and always support him

7. I would have a heart-to-heart conversation with him where I reassure him that I
will be supportive every step of the way and that he can reach out to me for
anything at any time

8. I would try to act normal and help

9. I would be glad that my friend is seeking professional help, tell him/her that I am
there to listen to his/her situation and will support her no matter what.

10. I would support the thought of therapy

11. What is your opinion on mental health?

12. Your body and mind must be fit in order to be a completely healthy person.

13. Mental health must be taken care a lot because it takes care of physical health

14. It’s very important to take care of your mental health

15. It is always very important

16. It is extremely important, especially in this day and age, to maintain our mental
health. More and more students are being affected by mental illness every day and
this is an indication of the fact that young people nowadays are dealing with
paramount stress and and/or trauma and many don’t have a proper outlet and
support system.

17. It is important for the well-being of an individual

18. Mental health has become a highly ignored part of our life. We should focus on what
really makes us important for every single day of our life.

19. It is something that is to be treated with care.

20. More important than our physical health.

21. It can be cured.

22. Can it be cured?

23. Mostly positive response

# Inferences from this sUrvey
We received positive response from the students of VIT. We are glad that the students are
aware about mental health and related symptoms and cure. Some key points inferred from
the survey-
1. Most people live today a stressful and fast life, so mental health is extremely
important aspect of our lives.

2.  Mental health is equally important as physical health and mental health has a
significant effect on our physical health.

3.  Mental health is an emotional and psychological state of well-being.

4.  Good mental health leads an individual to create a healthy balance between personal,
professional and social lives.

5. Mental health needs equal attention as physical health as often mental health is
dismissed as unimportant.

6.  The general opinion is that mental health issues are increasing due to technological
advancements and stressful professional working environments.

7.  The majority of students are aware of the common mental illness like PTSD, anorexia,
OCD etc. and their cure.

8.  Most common symptoms like depression, anxiety and suicidal tendencies can be easily
cured by regular exercise, talking to therapists and moreover talking to friends and
sharing your issues.
It was therefore clear that it wasn’t the lack of knowledge about mental health or societal
shunning that was stopping us from integrating mental wellness practice in our college.
Rather we were able to deduce that it was in fact the lack of a systematic approach and
platform for such activities such as counselling in our routines. Thus we decided that the
way to combat our issue was to design the required system with specification that would
enable mental health to easily be consolidated in our existing college schedules. We also
decided to create a platform where people could obtain counselling services as that is what
many students like us are truly lacking in VIT.
# EXECUTION
# VIT COUNSELLING SCHEME
Certain guidelines can be framed for counselling of students and instructions to be followed by
students in day to day life in order to relieve stress and live happily.
Some key points of rUles for higher EDUcational instiTUTIons
1. The institutions should appoint trained counsellors. They should havenecessary
qualification and experience in clinical psychology.
2. The Teaching Faculty should also be given some basic training on psychology of
youngsters and teens because they are major stakeholders in students’ career
advancement.

3. There should be compulsory interactive sessions with counsellors every week. This
should be given a special place in students’ time table. The students can put up any
issue before the respective counsellor if they are facing.
4. Counsellors will conduct refreshment sessions for students i.e. Yoga, self-meditation,
which is useful for relieving stress and students would feel energetic after the
session.
5. An online counselling portal should be made where students can put uptheir
problems or on behalf of their roommates.
6. A Committee of counsellors should be appointed where senior students can also be
members along with the counsellors and faculty members. The student counsellors
can better understand the psychology of juniors as they recently crossed through
that stage.
7. Counsellors will recommend menu based on healthy diet which is to be followed by
the mess caterers.
# Rules to be followed by Counsellors
1. They will give adequate time to a student as per his need. They should meet the
students regularly on the fixed hours for them. Each student must be allotted a
minimum of 40 minutes per week.
2. They should be online on the counsellors’ portal for at least 4 hours in the day. They
will respond to queries received when they are offline on daily basis.
3. Residential counsellors will be available in the hostel premises in shift duty.
4. They should give each student to perform what they can in the refreshment classes.
5. They should also test student members of counselling committee as how awareare
they of the psychological issues and treatment methods.
6. They will inform the Examination committee and Academic Council if a student
needs leave for treatment or as the situation may be.
7. They should also be available to visit hostel rooms on special request or if their
professional opinion indicates that a student be suffering from depression or an
episode of anxiety, hysteria or panic.

# Rules for Students
1. Students should never miss the weekly meeting with counsellors. If they do miss
meetings they should provide a valid reason to their counsellor and schedule a
compensatory session either physically or digitally.
2. They are recommended to partake in the additional activities divulged by the
counsellor such as Yoga or exercise.
3. They should be ready to perform the activity in refreshment class. A judgemental or
negatively impacting view on their peers in the classroom such as taunting or
laughing will not be tolerated.
4. They should inform the counsellors if any friend or roommate in their circle is
showing symptoms of clinical depression through online website or inperson.
5. The members of counselling committee should keenly observe their surroundings in
hostel and should talk to students to check whether they are suffering from any
mental illness.
6. The counselling members should guide the student suffering from depression to
approach the counsellors and get the correct treatment.
# WEBSITE
To fulfil the objective of establishing a service that functions fully online, we thought a
website would be the best option. Even after our efforts at normalizing the process of
attending counselling some people may still be reluctant to express themselves freely face
to face either due to reserved nature or due to fear of prejudice. This may hinder their
recovery as they are not able to truly immerse themselves in the counselling process.
Furthermore there are those who are simply so occupied with their schedule that they are
not able to take out the time to talk to a counsellor. For these people we have established a
website found at the address: https://msubhaditya.wixsite.com/e-counsellor
It has a simple minimalist layout intended not to confuse or overwhelm the user.
Furthermore we have chosen the colours and the fonts that look bright and uplifting but
also do not stand out overly so that a calm and positive vibe is felt just as soon as the user
opens the page.

The main feature of the website is the "Let’s Talk" feature. It can be accessed by any of the
pages by simply clicking the button at the top of the page. This will lead to a form where the
user can enter the name, contact details and what is bothering them. It has a simple, and
perceptive design and can be easily found in the navigation.
The additional features we have added to the website that were not originally included in
our objectives is a mini blog section. Here we have encouraged users to share with us their
stories of battling mental health that will be featured on the website. Writing is one of the
recommended forms of healing and expression as noted by various studies therefore we
thought it would be a great idea to encourage expression through creative writing.
Furthermore the pieces would function as a source of hope and inspiration for those who
visit the page so that they know they are not alone.
On a separate page of the website we have included the guidelines for the VIT counselling
scheme so that there is one source for all the counselling information required by the user.
It can be accessed from the homepage from the counselling guidelines menu option. As an
additional feature we have added a few pages that give out some information about mental
health and how to live a mindful life. This goes with our objectives of spreading awareness
about mental health to the public and to reduce stigma against it.
Overall the site functions well without any bugs and the flow of the menus are smooth and
not too heavy on the server so that it loads in a short amount of time. In order to make the
website we have used an online tool Wix.com which allows us to fully customize the website
according to our needs.

# RESULTS
We decided that as this website was designed for the students and faculty of VIT we would
evaluate its effectiveness. The following are some of the reviews we received for our
website and the rules.
# AKASH, student
“This is a great initiative. It will be really helpful. It would be great if you could specify the
details (qualifications at least) of people whom we would be talking to, because we should
know whom we are expressing our problems to. Furthermore I would really like to
commend you all on the website design as it is extremely aesthetically pleasing and calming
to look at. If such a system was actually put into place by VIT I think I would use it very
often”
# SAROJ, student
“Very nice!! In this era a trustworthy virtual friend would be better option to deal with
depression. The person talking would not be ashamed or embarrassed and could undertake
their service in their own time so it is a boon to people with a lot of credits or busy schedule.
If I was to point out a criticism it might be that if the counselling hours suggested by the
scheme are weekly they may become a burden if we have exams or other important
schedules during the time. However I do recognize that our focus needs to be shifted from
academics to wellbeing so a great deign and system.”
# SARTHAK, student“
I often thought of approaching counsellors whenever I was feeling low or depressed but
always hesitated thinking my friends and others would make fun of me or distance themselves
from me. An online service like this would completely solve this problem as we can avail it
without disclosing it to others. A suggestion from my side would be to add an anonymous
feature to the online counselling service as some of us may feel uncomfortable revealing their
identities and personal issues openly”

# MISS LAVANYA, Soft Skills Faculty
“I really wish such a facility was available in my college days. I remember often feeling like I
had no one to share my problems and as a faculty I know that my students face similar
problems even today so such a scheme will be beneficial to all and will certainly improve the
academic performance as well as enthusiasm of students. I hope that you can extend the
scheme to faculty members as well. Oh and very beautiful design of the website as well.
Kudos to you guys!”
# PROFESSOR VENKATRAMAN, Faculty
“Great initiative. Try to make it so that none of the counsellors are overburdened as they
also have a life outside work. I will recommend to my students if such a thing is put into
place as many of them always look depressed and tired and they are all under a lot of
pressure from their parents and teachers to do well. Hope it becomes a reality”
The pattern we observe in these reviews is that after seeing the model working all the
reviewer realize that they have at one point of time felt the need for such a service in their
life but were not able to obtain it due to the lack of any established system or platform.
Many of the reviews also note the design and formatting of the website and its suitability
especially the students which helps us know that we have achieved our motive as far as the
website and its user likeability goes.
Furthermore many of the reviews noted that they would be more likely to use such a system
than conventional counselling and that it would be really helpful to them or to those around
them. We were also able to identify some drawbacks or possible improvements to the
system such as extending it to faculty members, making sure neither students nor
counsellors are over burdened by the inclusion of this scheme in their schedules, and having
an available profile on the counsellors that the students can access.

# CONCLUSION
The aims of this study were to identify and evaluate the types of mental health self-care
support used by, and available to, VIT students and to establish our own working model of
an improved counselling system. Moreover, in doing so, we have developed a model of
mental health-care support that can help management and practitioners make decisions
about the organization as well be a starting point for a full-fledged mental health support
system here at VIT.
The significance of the sUrvey
The study we performed contributes to the knowledge base by attempting to
comprehensively self-care support in the context of VIT student’s mental health, an area
that is generally under-researched. It is also unique in that it has considered the evidence
from a variety of perspectives including both effectiveness as well as pure subjective
feelings and has attempted to integrate those perspectives into a meaningful synthesis
which we were able to implement in our project.
Will it make a difference?
Overall we would like to note that although our model is a facilitator for the meaningful
change we envision in the lifestyles and mental well-being of college students the true
impact on our society can only come when we ourselves shape our mind sets about mental
health and those suffering from it. While we as a community place extreme importance in
fleeting things like grades, marks, judgements and labels, we forget that the cornerstone of
our society is based on how happy and mentally well its people are. Therefore we hope that
this project can in even some small way help us at VIT move towards such a society that all
students, faculty and staff will be proud to be a part of.
